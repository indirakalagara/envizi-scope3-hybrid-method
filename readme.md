# Scope 3 Hybrid method of calculation

## Scope 3 introdcution

Scope 3 emissoions are all indirect emissions which are the result of the activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization.
Scope 3 emissions are basically all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain. For majority of the companies, Scope 3 emissionss have the most significant contribution in their overall GHG emissions.


## Scope 3 Categories and Calculation Methods supported in Envizi

The GHG Protocol defines 15 categories of scope 3 emissions which include emissions for  both upstream and downstream of the organization’s activities.

There are 4 different calculation methods available for calculating Scope 3 emissios and depedends the availability of data for the reporting company. 

### Supplier-specific method
Collects product-level cradle-to-gate GHG inventory data from goods or services suppliers.

### Hybrid method
Uses a combination of supplier-specific activity data (where available) and secondary data to fill the gaps. 

### Average-data method 
Estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the mass (e.g., kilograms or pounds), or other relevant units of goods or services purchased and multiplying by the relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good or service).

### Spend-based method
Estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the economic value of goods and services purchased and multiplying it by relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per monetary value of goods).




## Envizi Virtual Accounts setup

The AI Assist feature of Envizi uses a natural language processing (NLP) engine to identify the Scope 3 category based on spend transaction descriptions  provided by the user. Envizi provides a template , following which user prepares and upload the spend-based data to AI Assit.
AI Assist will pre-process the spend-based records and assign a mappting Account style.  The user will review the account styles allocated by AI, and then submit the file for loading directly, or modify the account style allocations manually and re-upload a modified file for loading.

Currently AI Assit feature supports Scope 3 Category 1 Purchased Goods and Services and further work is going on to ehance the same to support other Scope 3 categories.
